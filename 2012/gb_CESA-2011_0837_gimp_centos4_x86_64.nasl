tag_insight = "The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is an image composition and
  editing program.

  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the GIMP's Microsoft Windows Bitmap (BMP) and Personal Computer
  eXchange (PCX) image file plug-ins. An attacker could create a
  specially-crafted BMP or PCX image file that, when opened, could cause the
  relevant plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2009-1570, CVE-2011-1178)
  
  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's Paint Shop Pro
  (PSP) image file plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PSP
  image file that, when opened, could cause the PSP plug-in to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the GIMP. (CVE-2010-4543)
  
  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's Sphere Designer
  image filter. An attacker could create a specially-crafted Sphere Designer
  filter configuration file that, when opened, could cause the Sphere
  Designer plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2010-4541)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank Stefan Cornelius of Secunia Research for
  responsibly reporting the CVE-2009-1570 flaw.
  
  Users of the GIMP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The GIMP must be
  restarted for the update to take effect.";
